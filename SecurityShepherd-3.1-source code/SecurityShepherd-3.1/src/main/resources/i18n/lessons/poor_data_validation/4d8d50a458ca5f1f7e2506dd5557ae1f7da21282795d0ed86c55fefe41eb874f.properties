paragraph.info.2 = Attackers can take advantage of poor data validation to perform business logic attacks or cause server errors.
paragraph.info.3 = When data is submitted to a web application, it should ensure that the data is strongly typed, has correct syntax, is within length boundaries, contains only permitted characters and within range boundaries.
